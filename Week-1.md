# Week 1

## Goals
1. TDD programming - understand the syntax of Rspec.
2. Practice pair programming using the driver/navigator style.
3. 

## Reflection of day 1 and 2
Time management: My pair partner and I followed the pomodoro time management method, which meant we would work for 25 minutes, then take a 5 minute break, and when we came back swap who was the driver/navigator. This was new to me and I found being strict with the 25 minutes could be frustrating because half way through a question our alarm would go off and we'd break. After this happening twice we modified this to suit us better by taking breaks roughly every 25 minutes, but making sure we'd finished what we were doing so we wouldn't lose oure train of thought. This worked well as we were able to stay focused for longer without getting stressed.
